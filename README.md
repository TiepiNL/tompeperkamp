# Working with Tom: an unauthorized guide

This is a quick-start guide to navigating the Tom Peperkamp experience. It's a blunt (but hopefully helpful) tour of his personality and quirks. The goal is to help coworkers and peers understand Tom better, to accelerate their collaboration and improve the effectiveness of their interactions. 

This guide lays out Tom’s personal preferences. Tom realizes that not everyone ticks the same way, so please ask if you need him to adapt to your style. Tom is more than happy to try. Communication goes both ways, after all!

This document is not intended to replace or override the relationships and mutual understanding you will build as you work together. It's just to give you a glimpse into how Tom thinks and how he works.

Also, Tom writing down his own perceived personality faults isn't a free pass for bad behavior! Tom holds himself accountable for the impact he has on others, always.

## MBTI

*An INTJ (Architect) possesses a rare combination of vision and pragmatism. Their analytical mind constantly seeks to understand the world around them, driven by an insatiable curiosity and a desire to improve systems and ideas. They approach life with a strategic mindset, always looking several steps ahead and planning for various contingencies.*

# Tom’s Big Professional Values - What Gets Him Going!

What gets Tom excited and keeps him going at work? Here are the values that drive him:

- **Competence & Mastery**: Tom is always striving to get better at what he does. He has a drive for excellence, and is always striving to develop his skills, seeking deep understanding and mastery of his fields. Basically, Tom wants to know his stuff really well.
- **Innovation**: Tom gets his energy from the innovative and challenging aspect of growth and improvement, finding new solutions for old issues.
- **Objectivity**: Tom tries to base his decisions on logic and data, not just gut feelings. He cares about what can be measured, so we can tell if our actions were on the right path. Tom strives to always be rational, based on good reasoning - that said, he can be very stubborn too.
- **Effectiveness & Purposefulness**: Tom is all about achieving goals and making a difference. Tom likes to work on something with a clear "why" and see it move forward. At the end of the day, what we accomplish and what he contributes is more important to Tom than necessarily who he’s working alongside (although working with great people is a big plus!).
- **Self-organization**: Tom’s independent nature and preference for autonomy make him seek the freedom to manage his own work.

Tom’s mantra: “*Persistently challenging the status quo!*”

# Tom’s Allergy Zone

- Dogma & the inability to articulate a clear “why” of doing something (especially in case of bureaucracy and formal processes).
- The status quo, and a lack of willingness to change that.
- Lack of transparency and rationality in processes and decision making.
- Taylorism, output/utilization-focus, micro-management.
- Complaining without taking responsibility/action to improve the situation.
- Closed-mindedness, the lack of openness to different perspectives and willingness to minor shifts in belief.

# Tom’s Expectations of Everyone (Including Himself)

In general Tom’s expectations can be summed up as: be ambitious, reliable, outcome-oriented, and not an *sshole. In more detail:

- **Stretch yourself**: Seek learning and move faster than your comfort zone permits.
- **Clarify**: When asked to do something that feels poorly defined you should ask for clarification and a specific call on importance.
- **Own promises**: If you tell you will do something, do it to the very best of your ability on time.
- **Own failures**: If you fail at something, be transparent about it, own it, and not make excuses. Bonus points if you can articulate the lessons learned (and apply them!).
- **Give credits**: If you succeed at something, give credit to everyone involved.
- **Assume Positive Intent** (API): Give people the benefit of the doubt, identify the situational details, and get the bigger picture.

Tom will do this, too.

# Tom’s Preferred Ways of Communication

Tom really values clear, direct communication and logical reasoning. He is mostly interested in what needs to be done next, to move an issue or topic forward. As an introvert, Tom tends to skip small-talk and prioritize getting directly to the core. It also means that prolonged exposure to people is exhausting for me.

Flow and focus are important to Tom. He appreciates it if people respect his availability status for synchronous communication.

For areas Tom’s not familiar with, or for areas where he lacks context, he needs to do some prep work. It is generally ineffective to surprise Tom with conversation topics, so providing him with context and time to think/process will help him be more effective.

## Communication Channels

DMs for quick topics, email for larger topics requiring thought, unscheduled phone calls if something is really on fire, face-to-face for anything sensitive or requiring discussion or shared brainstorming.

### Phone/Video Calls

- Tom *really* doesn’t like sudden calls. He prefers asynchronous to synchronous: best ask him by chat first if it’s OK to have a call (and mention the subject!), so he is not caught off-guard!
- If it’s not urgent or blocking your flow of work, then Tom prefers to schedule calls first with a calendar invite.
- Tom will usually not answer phone calls without caller ID.
- Don’t leave a voice message, send Tom a DM instead.
- Tom prefers video calls over voice-only calls.

### Email

- Email is for non-urgent matters. Assume Tom will see your email within 24-48 hours, unless you ask him to look at it sooner over DM.
- For most cases, Tom prefers DM over email.
- Email Tom for initiating a larger topic that needs thought.
- Alternatively, if you have a complex question or need a discussion on something async that will require more than a few sentences for Tom to reply, consider putting it into a document and share it with him with comments. Tom is pretty efficient at giving feedback this way.
- Tom loves to read about successes and interesting insights. When you send him something you saw, a customer anecdote, an article, some data, or something someone on the team did, then write FYI in the subject or in the forward so Tom will know it’s for his information but *not- requiring response or urgent reading. He will do the same for you.
- If Tom is in cc, then he considers the email FYI (= no response required from him).

### DM / Chat

- If you need Tom to respond quickly, then best send him a DM. 
- Short questions via DM are always fine, even when Tom is “red” or out of hours – but he might be inconsistent in response times. Tom does try to respond to every direct message he gets every day. Expect a 90% success rate.
- Tom won't be offended if you go straight to asking him a question without any greeting – just keep the message concise! You can expect the same from him if you interact frequently.

#### Personal

Signal is Tom’s preferred chat tool, but WhatsApp works too. He’s generally quite bad at replying.

## Calendar

- Tom really cares about having control over his calendar. Rule of thumb: if it’s not in Tom’s calendar, it’s not happening!
- Tom’s work calendar is deliberately open and accessible so colleagues can see his availability. If you have a question about a meeting on his calendar, just ask. If a meeting is private or confidential, its title and attendees will be hidden. The vast majority of his meetings are neither private nor confidential.
- Tom often blocks off significant chunks of time so that he can get work done (“GTD” items).
- Tom also reserves significant blocks for - scheduled - synchronous communication. Outside these blocks, he prefers asynchronous communication (DMs).
- If Tom has his time blocked as “GTD” or “Reservation” please don't schedule meetings. If you really, really need time with him during those windows, please ask – but the bar will be high.
- Schedule in advance. Tom prefers to plan his coming week on Fridays and doesn't respond well to last-second requests. DM Tom/send an invite to arrange anything.

## Meetings

Tom knows meetings can be a real timesuck, so let's try to make them as efficient as possible!

### Meeting Requests

- What Tom considers a "meeting" must include an agenda and/or intended purpose. So, what are we trying to accomplish, and how will we know we got there?
- Tom believes in minimal meetings, so if he asks you if a meeting is necessary, it's nothing personal.
- If it’s not clear to Tom why he’s invited, he will ask for clarification on his role in this meeting.
- Tom loves walking meetings for 1:1s.

### During Meetings

- If someone is not benefitting or contributing to the meeting, it is okay for Tom to leave the meeting.
- If we don’t need  all the scheduled time, Tom prefers to cancel or end early. Time is precious!

# Times/Hours Tom Likes to Work

Generally consider Tom’s work hours to be 9.30am to 5.30pm on days when he’s in the office. When Tom works remotely, he works more flexible hours. If Tom is not available during his normal hours for some reason, he’ll mark it on his calendar.

## After-hours communication

Tom completely respects that you should have agency over when and how you want to work though, and he will always try his best to make sure that he doesn't message outside of your usual working times. Either way, you should never feel obligated to respond until you are working.

# Conditions Tom Likes to Work In

Tom especially loves and values people who are intellectually curious, open to innovative ideas, and dedicated to achieving high standards of quality. He appreciates directness, competence, and a willingness to engage in strategic discussions.

Tom excels in Agile environments with the ability to determine when and how he works, when given the space to work independently and implement innovative ideas, especially when his contribution can be implemented in a pragmatic way. Tom enjoys a good challenge, but in his drive for excellence he also wants the time to do things right. Tom wants to be left alone from distraction to complete his responsibilities in a high-quality fashion, and that is where he’s most happy.

Tom feels the most satisfaction and joy from work in environments that are/value:

- **Independent decision-making**: Workplaces that offer significant autonomy in how Tom can set his own goals, approach his work, and manage his projects allow Tom to leverage his strategic thinking skills effectively.
- **Results-oriented**: Environments that prioritize outcomes over processes align well with Tom’s goal-oriented nature. Tom performs best when he has clear objectives and the freedom to determine how to achieve them – within clear constraints.
- **Intellectual challenge**: Tom excels in settings that consistently present complex challenges and opportunities for learning – roles that require continuous adaptation and growth keep him engaged.
- **Innovation-focused**: Tom thrives in environments that encourage creative thinking and novel approaches to problem-solving, and value and invest in innovation.
- **Focus on quality**: Work environments that prioritize high standards and excellence align with Tom’s perfectionist tendencies.

# How Tom Learns (Best)

Here’s how Tom’s brain likes to process new information – might be useful for training or anything you want to teach him!

- Tom spends many hours a week on edutainment; it’s his favorite way to kill time. He loves to listen to podcasts, read books and newsletters, attend webinars, watch conference call recordings, engage on LinkedIn, take Coursera courses, and even play around with DuoLingo.
- Old-fashioned, instructor-led courses aren’t Tom’s cup of tea, especially in a traditional classroom. Tom prefers a more organic and self-directed approach to learning, and doesn't really value certificates that much either.
- Tom won’t be motivated to learn something if he doesn’t see why it’s valuable and how it aligns with his goals. So show him the value, first!
- If you want to teach Tom something, the best way to do it is start with a high-level visualization, explain the core principles, and then provide practical examples.

# How Tom Gives Feedback

- Tom believes in transparent, two-way communication and feedback. Both positive and constructive.
- Tom tries to *challenge directly while caring personally* (Radical Candor). Call him out if the caring part is missing!
- Tom likes to ask a lot of questions. This can feel like interrogation or judgment, but it is only curiosity.

# How Tom Likes to Receive Feedback

Fueled by his drive for excellence, Tom welcomes and greatly appreciates direct and constructive feedback as it provides an opportunity to learn and make a positive change – and takes it unemotionally and impersonally. The best way to give Tom feedback is honest and candid, timely, and specific. Kindness isn’t mandatory here, although Tom expects you not to be a jerk and to play the ball, not the man!

Some more specifics:

- Tom would rather have difficult conversations than things to be unsaid and carry on building up in the background.
- Give Tom a couple of specific examples and suggestions so he gets a clear sense of how he can improve. Or let me see what I can copy from someone else.
- Tell Tom when you’ve seen him improve on your feedback. He might think that he doesn't change that much, so please point it out when he does!
- Tom prefers face-to-face talk (in-person or video call) for constructive feedback, as that gives a chance for dialogue and to clarify misunderstandings. If you're only comfortable kicking off a discussion with an email or a DM, Tom would rather you do that than not bring it up at all.
- If you're not comfortable giving Tom some feedback yourself, he'd love for you to give it to his line manager or to a Scrum Master so they can anonymously relay it to him, but Tom really encourages you to give it to him directly.
- Tom struggles to receive positive feedback because it makes him feel uncomfortable. Tom recognizes this, and he invites you to call him on it, especially if you don’t know where you stand with him.
- Also, Tom knows that opinions differ. Disagreement is feedback; the sooner we learn how to disagree with each other efficiently, the sooner we’ll trust and respect each other more. Ideas don’t get better with agreement.

# Options for Convincing Tom

You wanna bring Tom around to your way of thinking? Here are a few things that really help:

- The most effective way to persuade Tom is logic! And that means a clear, logical argument supported by well-researched data and evidence. Frame your reasoning in a structured manner, outlining the potential benefits and consequences of your idea and how it aligns with Tom’s values of effectiveness and purposefulness. If you come prepared with solid reasoning and information, he'll be way more receptive.
- Appealing to Tom’s intellectual curiosity and desire for (continuous) improvement works well. Present your idea as a novel solution or opportunity for strategic advantage. Demonstrating how it addresses a specific problem or optimizes a system, while also acknowledging potential risks and providing mitigation strategies, will significantly increase his interest.
- Avoid emotional appeals or vague pronouncements. Tom doesn't believe that people should be led by emotions. He is less swayed by enthusiasm or popularity and more drawn to demonstrable results and measurable outcomes. Be prepared to answer tough questions and defend your position with clear, concise, and evidence-based reasoning.
- Directness and honesty are key. Don't try to manipulate Tom or use emotional tactics. Instead, focus on the facts and logic behind your argument. Show him how your proposal will lead to tangible improvements in a clear and straight manner.

# Tom’s Super Powers

Prepare for some humblebragging! These are the skills and strengths that (he thinks) make Tom a valuable asset for the team:

- **Systems Thinking**: Tom sees things as systems. He reduces all complex things (including humans) into systems. He thinks in concepts and flowcharts. When he sees large or small inefficiencies in these complex systems, Tom would like to fix them – with your help.
- **Strategic vision**: Tom has the ability to see the big picture and plan for the long-term.
- **Strategic persistence**: Tom’s ability to maintain long-term focus, while adapting tactics based on new information, makes him exceptionally effective at maintaining progress and achieving personal goals. He has the ability to pivot without losing sight of his core objectives. Think big, act small.
- **Innovative solutions**: Tom is not satisfied with conventional approaches that are ineffective or “smell,” and often pioneers new methods.
- **Commitment to excellence**: Tom has a keen eye for detail and is committed to excellence in all his endeavors. He always wants the job done right.
- **Self-improvement**: Tom always wants to get better at things he’s passionate about. Whether it’s at work or at a Catan boardgame, he’s always looking to improve. It is what drives him!

# Things Tom Struggles With

To have it in balance, let's talk about weaknesses as well. Tom is definitely not perfect, so here's where things can get tricky:

- **Losing interest**: Tom loves ideation and launching initiatives, but he often loses interest when he can mentally see how the thing will finish, which might be weeks or months before the thing is done. Execution – as the act of properly ending things – is not his super power. Tom solves this by pairing with people who are strong operators and who are very good at ticking those things off the list.
- **Impatience with process and inefficiency**: As a result-oriented person, Tom is heavily biased toward action and believes that starting is the best way to begin learning and progress. This strategy may annoy those who like long debates, and make Tom appear blunt. With his drive for perfection, rapid progress, and efficiency, Tom has high expectations of others and his value judgments are based on others' ability to get results, which can lead to (self-)frustration when dealing with slower-paced individuals or processes. Tom can be persistent and determined even in the face of antagonism. He is aware that he has to meet people where they are, and tries to keep the proverb “if you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together” in mind, but sometimes needs an external reminder.
- **Impatient moods**: When Tom is in get-stuff-done mode, he’s sometimes impatient with friendly office chat. Usually, he likes to jump into the matters at hand quickly and directly.
- **Overlooking emotions**: Emotional expression and social niceties might sometimes be lost on Tom. His focus on logic and strategy and his measured approach to emotional (self-)expression might lead him to overlook the emotional aspects of leadership, teamwork, and personal growth. Please don't hesitate to directly communicate your feelings and needs to Tom, rather than expecting him to intuitively understand them.
- **Direct communication**: Tom’s high authenticity and impatience sometimes leads him to share uncomfortable truths without sufficient cushioning.
- **Rejecting social norms**: Tom’s strong drive for authenticity can make him being too quick to dismiss important social conventions.
- **Not asking for help**: Tom is bad at asking for help which is partially related to his introversion. When he asked for help, he probably should have asked for help earlier, and he’s made the situation direr than needed.

# Keep Tom Honest!

Take this document with a grain of salt: Tom wrote it himself! People usually do not know themselves as well as they think they know themselves, and Tom is certainly  not an exception here. He understands there’s a difference between *declared* and *revealed* preferences. Always trust your own view of Tom more than this guide.

So, what’s missing above? Or where is Tom lying to himself and others? If you have questions or suggestions for changes, feel free to reach out or to add to this document by submitting a pull request and make it a little more “authorized!” All feedback is welcome.

This document is a living breathing thing and likely incomplete. I update it frequently and would be happy to include your feedback. Help me to keep things true!
